# Release notes for Craft CMS 4.11 (WIP)

### Content Management
- Entry and category conditions now have a “Has Descendants” rule. ([#15276](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/15276))
- “Replace file” actions now display success notices on complete. ([#15217](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15217))
- Double-clicking on folders within asset indexes and folder selection modals now navigates the index/modal into the folder. ([#15238](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/15238))

### Development
- Added the `withCustomFields` element query param.

### System
- Improved the performance of element indexes in structure view.
- The control panel now displays Ajax response-defined error messages when provided, rather than a generic “server error” message. ([#15292](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15292))
